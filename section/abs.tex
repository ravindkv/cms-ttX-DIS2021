{\bf
Latest results on inclusive and differential \PQt quark pairs, single \PQt, and {\ttbar}X 
production cross sections are presented using proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS 
experiment. The differential cross sections are measured as a function of various kinematic 
observables of the \PQt quarks, jets, and leptons of the event final state. The results are 
confronted with precise theory calculations and used to constrain Standard Model parameters. 
Measurements are also performed with high transverse momentum of the \PQt quarks, i.e., in the 
boosted regimes.
%Measurements of the cross section for the production of the single top with a \PW boson, top quark 
%pairs with and without additional quarks are presented at the different center of mass energies 
%with different integrated luminosity recorded by the CMS experiment during the years 2016-18 of 
%data-taking. The 
%measurement is performed in semi and dileptonic decay modes of the top quark. A few of them 
%are performed for the first time. The measured and the predicted value of the inclusive cross 
%section are in agreement within the uncertainties. The differential and double differential
%measurement has slight over-prediction in a certain kinematic region due to the mismodeling of 
%the event generator.
