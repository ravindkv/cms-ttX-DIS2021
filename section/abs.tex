{\bf
Latest results on inclusive and differential top quark pair and single top quark production cross 
sections are presented using proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment. The 
differential cross sections are measured as a function of various kinematic observables of the top 
quarks and the jets and leptons of the event final state. The results are confronted with precise 
theory calculations and used to constrain Standard Model parameters. Measurements are performed also 
with high \pt top quarks, i.e., in boosted regimes.
%Measurements of the cross section for the production of the single top with a \PW boson, top quark 
%pairs with and without additional quarks are presented at the different center of mass energies 
%with different integrated luminosity recorded by the CMS experiment during the years 2016-18 of 
%data-taking. The 
%measurement is performed in semi and dileptonic decay modes of the top quark. A few of them 
%are performed for the first time. The measured and the predicted value of the inclusive cross 
%section are in agreement within the uncertainties. The differential and double differential
%measurement has slight over-prediction in a certain kinematic region due to the mismodeling of 
%the event generator.
